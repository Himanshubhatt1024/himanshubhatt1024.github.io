			<p class="card-text">
				<li>Today when the class started, we have a brief of yesterdays topics like how to create an app, object as some doubts were there from the topics.</li>
				<li>We then learnt creating fields and adding them in our objects, we added many fields there like picklist, price, date & time, etc. </li>
				<li>All fields were added simply by just selecting them, then came the FORMULA field, in this we have to give a formula for the field we select and that was pretty much interesting.</li>
				<li>In adding that formula field we made use of some functions like IF, ISPICKVAL, CASE, MONTH, YEAR, HYPERLINK, IMAGE and some more..</li>
				<li>We practised these and ended our class by getting some assignment from our teacher.</li>
